# Pacemaker-Neuron-Model
Modelling Bursting Pacemaker Neurons in PreBotzinger Complex--
The objective of this project is to show that pacemaker neuron and network models successfully predicted features of inspiratory rhythm generation in vitro in the Pre-BotC

Pre-BÃ¶tzinger Complex(Pre-BotC)-
A cluster of interneurons in ventrolateral medulla, Hypothesized site for respiratory rhythm generation in mammals
Pacemaker Neurons-
Pre-BotC houses a heterogeneous population of bursting pacemaker neurons, Respiratory rhythm generation mechanism incorporates an excitatory network of synaptically coupled pacemaker neurons

Thin slices were cut from the medulla of neonatal rats in ACSF that captured the Pre-BotC and XIIn rootlets 
Rhythmic respiratory activity was maintained by raising the ACSF K+ concentration ([K+]o ),Inspiratory related motor discharge was recorded from the XIIn rootlets and inspiratory neuron population was simultaneously recorded from the Pre-BotC using macropatch suction electrodes,Measurement of cellular and network activity such as inspiratory burst period, frequency, and burst duration were determined,To identify pacemaker neurons CNQX and low Ca2+ solution was used  

The results obtained were-
A monotonic increase in burst frequency and decrease in burst duration with increasing [K+]o  concentration reflecting the inactivation kinetics of INaP
Multistate behaviour with transitions from quiescence to bursting and tonic spiking states as cells depolarizes i.e. cellular excitability was increased via extracellular [K+]o  concentration
This model incorporates the minimum set of conductances to generate bursting similar to pacemaker cells in the Pre-BotC
